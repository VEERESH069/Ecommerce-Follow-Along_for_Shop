# Ecommerce-Follow-Along_for_Shop
In this repo, you will find the brief information about the E-commerce platform and new features.

Mile Stone :- 1 (E- Commerce for Electronic items and Cloths)
# Project Description:-
This project is a full-stack e-commerce application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). It will provide a platform for users to browse products, manage their accounts, and make purchases. The goal of the project is to learn how to create scalable and secure web applications while gaining hands-on experience in building RESTful APIs, handling authentication, and designing database schemas.

# Milestone 1: Project Overview
In Milestone 1, we focused on laying the foundation for the e-commerce application by understanding the core technologies and concepts involved in building a MERN stack application. Here is a summary of what was covered:

Overview of the MERN Stack:

The MERN stack is a collection of JavaScript-based technologies used for building full-stack web applications. This stack includes:
MongoDB: A NoSQL database used for storing data.
Express.js: A web framework for Node.js that simplifies routing and server-side logic.
React: A front-end library for building user interfaces.
Node.js: A JavaScript runtime used to run the server-side code.
REST API Structure and Endpoints:

We discussed how RESTful APIs work and how they can be used to communicate between the client and server using standard HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.
API endpoints covered include:
User Authentication: For user registration and login functionality.
Product Management: To add, update, and retrieve product data.
Order Handling: To manage customer orders.
Basics of Database Schema Design:

We learned how to design a schema in MongoDB that outlines the structure and relationships of data for our application. This includes creating collections for users, products, and orders.
Role of Authentication in Web Applications:

Authentication is critical to ensuring that users are who they say they are. In our e-commerce application, authentication will be used to allow users to register, log in, and access secure areas like making purchases or viewing their account details.
Project Setup:

We set up the project repository and outlined the foundational steps for creating the MERN stack application. This includes configuring the project environment and preparing for future development milestones.
Core Concepts Covered:
Overview of the MERN stack and its components.
REST API creation and structuring endpoints.
Database schema design with MongoDB.
Understanding the role of authentication in web applications.
Setting up the initial project structure for the e-commerce platform.
